description: "Map Ashby custom fields to ClearOffer fields to automatically populate your offers."

Use custom field mapping to translate your Ashby `Offer` custom fields into ClearOffer fields. When an offer is created or updated in Ashby, ClearOffer will fill in matching fields automatically.

<Info>
Mappings only apply to offers that were created via the Ashby Integration. Existing offers created without using the Ashby integration aren't retroactively changed.

After creating a custom field mapping, you will need to make a new update to an offer in Ashby for the mapping to take effect.
</Info>

## Add or edit a mapping

Open ClearOffer and click on the `Company` toggle in the sidebar, then click on `Integrations` to open the Integrations page.

<Step title="Add Mapping">

Field names must match Ashby exactly (including spaces and casing).
</Tip>
</Step>
