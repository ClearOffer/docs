You can optionally present an NDA before candidates view sensitive offer details, and attach supporting PDFs for benefits or policy documents.

## NDA (optional)

- Require candidates to acknowledge an NDA before viewing full details
- Use for confidential roles or pre‑public information

## Attachments (optional)

- Add PDFs to benefits or link to external documentation
- Candidates can download attachments directly from the offer

<Tip>
Use clear names for attachments so candidates know what to expect (for example: “Health Plan Summary 2025”).
