- Base salary and currency
- Start date
- Job title (role)

## Verify the connection

- In ClearOffer, check your Offers list for a new unpublished offer
- If Offer Update is enabled, make a small change in Ashby and confirm it updates in ClearOffer

## Manual webhook setup (only if prompted)

ClearOffer attempts to create webhooks in Ashby for you. If that fails, you’ll see in‑app guidance with the exact URL and event types to add.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Add webhooks in Ashby">
1. In Ashby, go to Admin → Integrations → Webhooks
2. Create a webhook for each selected event (Offer Create, Offer Update)
3. Use the Request URL shown in ClearOffer’s Integrations page
4. Enable the webhook(s) and save

<Tip>
If you don’t see the URL in ClearOffer, contact your workspace admin or support.
